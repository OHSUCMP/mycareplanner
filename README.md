# MyCarePlanner SMART on FHIR app
MyCarePlanner is a standards-based web application platform for patients and caregivers to engage in their care planning for multiple chronic conditions (MCC). The application is designed to be a proof-of-concept application to enable goal-oriented care planning. Patients and caregivers are granted the ability to write information into the application to share with their providers and see their health data from all their providers in one place.

MyCarePlanner supports both [SMART](https://smarthealthit.org/) standalone launch and EHR launch from a patient portal. It can connect to any Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) endpoint based on 21st Century Cures Act access requirements for U.S. Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) data elements. MyCarePlanner is one common app for patients and caregivers. A caregiver role is identified based on proxy user login in the EHR system.

MyCarePlanner is being developed as part of a broader Electronic Care Planning for People with Multiple Chronic Conditions project led by the [National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases](https://www.niddk.nih.gov) (NIDDK) and the [Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality](https://cmext.ahrq.gov/confluence/display/EC/Multiple+Chronic+Conditions+%28MCC%29+e-Care+Plan+Project+Collaborative+Site) (AHRQ). The project is supported by a multidisciplinary team including EMI Advisors, RTI International, and the Oregon Health and Sciences University (OHSU).
